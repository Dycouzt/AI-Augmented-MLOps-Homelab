# ============================================================
# Project: AI-Powered Self-Healing DevSecOps Homelab
# ============================================================

## 1. Project Overview
This project demonstrates a fully integrated, on-premises DevSecOps homelab
that combines **secure CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes orchestration, monitoring,
security scanning, chaos engineering, and AI integration**.

The goal is to showcase:
- Cloud-agnostic deployments (runs fully on local infrastructure).
- Automated DevSecOps practices (shift-left security).
- AI-assisted workflows for:
  - Explaining pipeline failures.
  - Generating security/compliance policies.
  - Summarizing incidents and creating post-mortems.
- Self-healing infrastructure with automated remediation.

This project is designed to be **portfolio-ready** for DevOps/DevSecOps/SRE roles.

---

## 2. Core Features
- Secure CI/CD pipeline:
  - Build → Scan → Deploy → Monitor.
  - Integrated vulnerability scanning with **Trivy**.
- Kubernetes orchestration using **k3s** (lightweight k8s).
- GitOps-based deployments with **ArgoCD**.
- Security monitoring:
  - **Falco** for runtime threats.
  - **OPA/Gatekeeper** for compliance policies.
- Monitoring & Observability:
  - **Prometheus** + **Grafana** for metrics and dashboards.
  - **Loki** for log aggregation.
- Chaos Engineering:
  - **Chaos Mesh** for controlled failures.
- AI Agent (Gemini CLI or local LLM via Ollama):
  - Log summarization and root cause analysis.
  - Auto-generation of OPA policies from natural language.
  - Incident report automation.

## 3. Architecture (High-Level)

[Developer] --> [Git Repo] --> [CI/CD Pipeline]
                                |
                                v
                     [Kubernetes Cluster (k3s)]
                                |
            ------------------------------------------------

## 4. Tool Selection & Alternatives

### CI/CD:
- Primary: **GitHub Actions** with self-hosted runner.
- Alternatives: GitLab CE (includes registry & CI/CD), Jenkins.

### Kubernetes:
- Primary: **k3s** (lightweight).
- Alternatives: kind, minikube.

### GitOps:
- Primary: **ArgoCD**.
- Alternative: FluxCD.

### Monitoring & Logging:
- **Prometheus** (metrics).
- **Grafana** (dashboards).
- **Loki** (logs).
- Alternatives: ELK stack (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana).

### Security:
- **Trivy** (image scans).
- **Falco** (runtime).
- **OPA/Gatekeeper** (policies).
- Alternatives: Clair, Kyverno.

### Chaos Engineering:
- **Chaos Mesh**.
- Alternative: LitmusChaos.

### AI Integration:
- Primary: **Gemini CLI** (API-based).
- Alternative: **Ollama** with local models (Mistral 7B, Code Llama).
- Orchestration (optional): **LangChain**.

## 5. Hardware & Specs

### Tested System (Baseline):
- Device: MacBook Air M2 (16GB RAM).
- Specs: 8 cores (4 performance, 4 efficiency), 16GB unified memory, fast SSD.
- OS: macOS + Colima/OrbStack (for Docker ARM64 support).

### Observations:
- Runs full stack, but resource balancing is necessary.
- Not ideal for running ALL components simultaneously (may require selective enable/disable).

### Recommended Minimum Specs for Smooth Homelab:
- CPU: 4 cores (ARM or x86).
- RAM: 16GB (32GB preferred for full stack running at once).
- Storage: 256GB+ SSD.
- Network: Stable LAN/Wi-Fi.

### Alternative Hardware Solutions:
- **Mini PC (Intel NUC/AMD MiniPC)** with 32GB+ RAM → supports Proxmox and multiple VMs.
- **Raspberry Pi Cluster (ARM64)** for distributed homelab.
- **Old workstation/server** repurposed as homelab node.

## 6. Deployment Strategy (Phased)

### Phase 1: Core Pipeline
- Build and push container image.
- Scan with Trivy.
- Deploy to k3s via ArgoCD.

### Phase 2: Monitoring
- Add Prometheus, Grafana, Loki.
- Integrate logs with AI log analyzer.

### Phase 3: Security
- Add Falco + OPA policies.
- AI-generated compliance rules.

### Phase 4: Self-Healing Infra
- Prometheus alerts → automated remediation (restart pods, rollback).
- AI-generated incident explanations.

### Phase 5: Chaos Engineering
- Deploy Chaos Mesh.
- Run experiments → AI generates post-mortems.
